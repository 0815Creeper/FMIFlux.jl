## Introduction to the example
The Julia Package *FMIFlux.jl* is motivated by the application of hybrid modeling. For more detailed information on *FMIFlux.jl*, see the [introduction page](https://thummeto.github.io/FMIFlux.jl/dev/). This tutorial is an easy, code-focussed version of the paper [[1]](#Source), if you find it useful for your work, please cite the linked paper.

In this example, a real-world simulation model is enhanced in terms of accuracy using a so called *physics-enhanced neural ordinary differential equation* (PeNode). Basically, this is an extension to the NeuralODE concept and looks as can be seen in Fig. 1.

*Fig.1: A possible representation for a physics-enhanced neural ordinary differential equation (PeNODE). PeNODEs that include FMUs instead of symbolic ODEs are called NeuralFMUs.*

Note, that this is only one possible topology of a PeNODE, there could be an additional artifical neural network (ANN) before the ODE (that might share some connections with the other ANN) and other signals, like FMU state derivatives, inputs and outputs could be connected to the ANN(s). ODEs are in general not very handy, for modeling **real** applications, a more suitable container for ODEs is needed. The most common model exchange format in industry is the *Functional Mock-up interface* (FMI), models exported with FMI are called *Functional Mock-up unit* (FMU). Especially *model-exchange* FMUs can be seen as containers for ODEs. For more information, see ([fmi-standard.org](http://fmi-standard.org/)). So if you want to use a real model from your modeling tool (with FMI support), you can simply export an FMU instead of handling large and bulky ODEs. If PeNODEs use FMUs instead of ODEs, they are called NeuralFMUs [[2]](#Source).

In this tutorial series, a *vehicle longitudinal-dynamics model* (VLDM) is extended to a NeuralFMU (PeNODE) to make better consumption predictions.


## Target group
The example is primarily intended for users who work in the field of first principle and/or data driven modeling and are further interested in hybrid model building. The example shows how to combine FMUs with machine learning and illustrates the advantages of this approach.


## Other formats
Besides, this [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/thummeto/FMIFlux.jl/blob/examples/examples/mdpi_2022.ipynb) there is also a [Julia file](https://github.com/thummeto/FMIFlux.jl/blob/examples/examples/mdpi_2022.jl) with the same name, which contains only the code cells. For the documentation there is a [Markdown file](https://github.com/thummeto/FMIFlux.jl/blob/examples/examples/mdpi_2022.md) corresponding to the notebook.

## Part 1: Loading the FMU

To run the example, the previously installed packages must be included. 


```julia
# Loading in the required libraries
using FMIFlux   # for NeuralFMUs
using FMI       # import FMUs into Julia 
using FMIZoo    # a collection of demo models, including the VLDM

import FMI.DifferentialEquations: Tsit5     # import the Tsit5-solver
using JLD2                                  # data format for saving/loading parameters

# plotting
import Plots        # default plotting framework
import PlotlyJS     # plotting (interactive)
Plots.plotlyjs()    # actiavte PlotlyJS as default plotting backend

# Let's fix the random seed to make our program determinsitic (ANN layers are initialized indeterminsitic otherwise)
import Random 
Random.seed!(1234)

# we use the Tsit5 solver for ODEs here 
solver = Tsit5()    
```

Next, we load the FMU from the *FMIZoo.jl* and have a brief look on its metadata. For a detailed view, see the [Modelica model](https://github.com/ThummeTo/FMIZoo.jl/blob/main/models/src/VLDM.mo).


```julia
# load our FMU (we take one from the FMIZoo.jl, exported with Dymola 2022x)
fmu = fmiLoad("VLDM", "Dymola", "2022x"; type=:ME, logLevel=FMI.FMIImport.FMULogLevelInfo)

# let's have a look on the model meta data
fmiInfo(fmu)
```

As you can see, in section *States* there are six states listed:

| ID  | Value Reference | Value Name(s)                                                                                    | Description                                          | 
|:----|:----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | 33554432        | "driver.accelerationPedalController.PI.x"                                                        | PI-Controller state (integrated error), accelerating |       
| 2   | 33554433        | "driver.brakePedalController.PI.x"                                                               | PI-Controller state (integrated error), braking      | 
| 3   | 33554434        | "drivingCycle.s"                                                                                 | vehicle position (target)                            |
| 4   | 33554435        | "dynamics.accelerationCalculation.integrator.y"                                                  | vehicle position (actual)                             |
| 5   | 33554436        | "dynamics.accelerationCalculation.limiter.u", "dynamics.accelerationCalculation.limIntegrator.y" | vehicle velocity (actual)                            |
| 6   | 33554437        | "result.integrator.y"                                                                            | cumulative consumption * 3600                        |

Next thing is having a look on the real measurement data, that comes with the FMU. The VLDM and corresponding data are based on the [Component Library for Full Vehicle Simulations](https://github.com/TUMFTM/Component_Library_for_Full_Vehicle_Simulations) [[3]](#Source).


```julia
# load data from FMIZoo.jl, gather simulation parameters for FMU
data = FMIZoo.VLDM(split=:train)
tStart = data.consumption_t[1]
tStop = data.consumption_t[end]
tSave = data.consumption_t

# have a look on the FMU parameters (these are the file paths to the characteristic maps)
data.params
```

Finally, we do a single simulation run and compare the simulation output to the real data.


```julia

# let's run a simulation from `tStart` to `tStop`, use the parameters we just viewed for the simulation run
resultFMU = fmiSimulate(fmu, (tStart, tStop); parameters=data.params) 
fig = fmiPlot(resultFMU)                                                                        # Plot it, but this is a bit too much, so ...
fig = fmiPlot(resultFMU; stateIndices=6:6)                                                      # ... only plot the state #6 and ...
fig = fmiPlot(resultFMU; stateIndices=6:6, ylabel="Cumulative consumption [Ws]", label="FMU")   # ... add some helpful labels!

# further plot the (measurement) data values `consumption_val` and deviation between measurements `consumption_dev`
Plots.plot!(fig, data.consumption_t, data.consumption_val; label="Data", ribbon=data.consumption_dev, fillalpha=0.3)
```

## Part 2: Designing the Topology

After we have successful loaded the FMI, had a look inside its model description and simulated it, we want to build a hybrid model (NeuralFMU) with our FMU as its core. 

### Part 2a: Interfaces between ANNs and FMUs
What happens between ANNs and FMUs?

Note, that FMUs and ANNs don't operate within the same numerical ranges. Whereas FMU signals can basically use the entire range of a Float64, ANNs operate the best in a range that suits theire activation functions. Many activation functions saturate their input values. Consider the $tanh$-activation, that acts almost linear close around $0$, but drastically saturates values further away from zero:


```julia
for i in [0.0, 0.01, 0.1, 1.0, 10.0, 100.0, 1000.0]
    println("tanh($(i)) = $(tanh(i))")
end
```

Similarly for the opposite direction: Signals from ANNs into FMUs may be too small, because of the limited output of the ANNs. To prevent this issue, an appropriate transformation (like shifting and scaling) between ANNs and FMUs is necessary. In the following code section, the results of ignoring this is shown, together with a fix by using the provided `ScaleShift`- and `ShiftScale`-layers from *FMIFlux.jl*.


```julia
# variable we want to manipulate - why we are picking exactly these three is shown a few lines later ;-)
manipulatedDerVars = ["der(dynamics.accelerationCalculation.integrator.y)",
                      "der(dynamics.accelerationCalculation.limIntegrator.y)",
                      "der(result.integrator.y)"]
# alternative: manipulatedDerVars = fmu.modelDescription.derivativeValueReferences[4:6]

# reference simulation to record the derivatives 
resultFMU = fmiSimulate(fmu, (tStart, tStop), parameters=data.params, recordValues=:derivatives, saveat=tSave) # [29s]
vals = fmiGetSolutionValue(resultFMU, manipulatedDerVars)

# what happens without propper transformation between FMU- and ML-domain?
Plots.plot(resultFMU.values.t, vals[1,:][1]; label="vehicle velocity");
Plots.plot!(resultFMU.values.t, tanh.(vals[1,:][1]); label="tanh(velocity)")

# setup shift/scale layers for pre-processing
preProcess = ShiftScale(vals)

# check what it's doing now ...
testVals = collect(preProcess(collect(val[t] for val in vals))[1] for t in 1:length(resultFMU.values.t))
Plots.plot(resultFMU.values.t, testVals; label="velocity (pre-processed)");
Plots.plot!(resultFMU.values.t, tanh.(testVals); label="tanh(velocity)")
```


```julia
# add some additional "buffer"
preProcess.scale[:] *= 0.5 
testVals = collect(preProcess(collect(val[t] for val in vals))[1] for t in 1:length(resultFMU.values.t))
Plots.plot(resultFMU.values.t, testVals; label="velocity (pre-processed)");
Plots.plot!(resultFMU.values.t, tanh.(testVals); label="tanh(velocity)")
```


```julia
# ... also check the consumption
testVals = collect(preProcess(collect(val[t] for val in vals))[3] for t in 1:length(resultFMU.values.t))
Plots.plot(resultFMU.values.t, testVals; label="vehicle consumption (pre-processed)");
Plots.plot!(resultFMU.values.t, tanh.(testVals); label="tanh(consumption)")
```


```julia
# setup scale/shift layer (inverse transformation) for post-processing
# we don't an inverse transform for the entire preProcess, only for the second element (acceleration)
postProcess = ScaleShift(preProcess; indices=2:2)
```

As a little extra, these shifting and scaling parameters are optimized together with the ANN parameters in the later training process!

### Part 2b: ANN in- and output
Besides shifting and scaling, a major question is: What signals should be fed into the ANN and what signals should be output by it? We need to make some considerations:
- **What should be learned?** In theory, we could manipulate every interface signal from an to the FMU, but in real life this is not efficient. The more signals we connect, the more partial derivatives need to be determined during training. So if there is something you know about the model (and often there is more than just *something*) you can use that knowledge to make your hybrid model more efficient. So ask yourself: *What* should be learned? And right after that: *How* could it be learned? In mechanical applications the answer will often be: A force (or momentum in rotational systems). Forces result in a change of acceleration, so they can be expressed by an additional acceleration. In mechanical systems, the acceleration is almost always a state derivative (the derivative of the velocity), so in many cases, manipulating the lowest state derivative - the acceleration - is a very good choice. 
- **How many ANNs do we need?** Technically, you can add an arbitrary number of ANNs around your FMU (you can also use multiple FMUs if you want). But again, one should not use more than a single ANN if there is no good reason to do so. A second ANN *before* the FMU can be useful for example, if measurment offsets or similar effects should be corrected. Often, a single ANN to modify the state dynamics is sufficient.
- **What signals from the FMU should be inserted into the ANN?** In theory, we could use them all, meaning all states, state derivatives, time, inputs, outputs and other variables that are accessible through FMI. You know what comes next: Using less signals is the better choice, of course. If you know that the physical effect (here: the friction force), you have also an idea what *influences* this effect or at least you know what values will have no impact and can be neglected to enhance training performance.

At this specific example, the following considerations were made:

| | Consideration                                                                                                                         | Considered inputs for the ANN |
|:---|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|
| 1. | we have no inputs, nothing to add                                                                                                       | $\{\}$ |  
| 2. | we have no outputs, nothing to add                                                                                                      | $\{\}$ | 
| 3. | we have six states, that may influence the effect, add them                                                                                     | $\{x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5, x_6\}$ |  
| 4. | we have six state derivatives, that may influence the effect, add them                                                                         | $\{x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5, x_6\, \dot{x}_1, \dot{x}_2, \dot{x}_3, \dot{x}_4, \dot{x}_5, \dot{x}_6\}$ |  
| 5. | the system is modelled as second order ODE, the state $x_5$ (velocity) equlas the state derivative $\dot{x}_4$, remove $x_5$ | $\{x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_6\, \dot{x}_1, \dot{x}_2, \dot{x}_3, \dot{x}_4, \dot{x}_5, \dot{x}_6\}$ | 
| 6. | we know that the friction effect is not dependent on the driver controller, remove two states ($x_1$ and $x_2$) and state derivatives ($\dot{x}_1$ and $\dot{x}_2$) | $\{x_3, x_4, x_6\, \dot{x}_3, \dot{x}_4, \dot{x}_5, \dot{x}_6\}$ | 
| 7. | we know that the friction effect is not dependent on the target driving cycle position $x_3$ or velocity $\dot{x}_3$, remove them | $\{x_4, x_6\, \dot{x}_4, \dot{x}_5, \dot{x}_6\}$ | 
| 8. | we assume that the friction effect is not dependent on the vehicle position $x_4$, remove $x_4$ | $\{x_6\, \dot{x}_4, \dot{x}_5, \dot{x}_6\}$ | 
| 9. | we assume that the friction effect is not dependent on the accumulated vehicle consumption $x_6$, remove $x_6$ | $\{\dot{x}_4, \dot{x}_5, \dot{x}_6\}$ | 

These considerations lead to the following topology:

![usedneuralfmu.svg](https://github.com/thummeto/FMIFlux.jl/blob/main/docs/src/examples/img/mdpi_2022/usedneuralfmu.svg?raw=true)

*Fig.2: The used topology for a NeuralFMU in this example. The ANN operates based on the signals $\dot{x}_4, \dot{x}_5, \dot{x}_6$ from the FMU, but only modifies the signal $\hat{\dot{x}}_5$. The gates $p_{FMU}$ and $p_{ANN}$ control how much the dynamics of FMU and ANN contribute to the NeuralFMU dynamics. Starting with $p_{FMU}=1.0$ and $p_{ANN}=0.0$ makes an initialization routine obsolete, because the dynamics of the NeuralFMU equal the dynamics of the FMU, see [[1]](#Source) for further details.*

### Part 2c: Translating topology to Julia
To implement the signal bypass in a layer sequence, two layers named `CacheLayer` and `CacheRetrieveLayer` are used to cache and retrieve arbitrary values:


```julia
# setup cache layers 
cache = CacheLayer()
cacheRetrieve = CacheRetrieveLayer(cache)

gates = ScaleSum([1.0, 0.0]) # signal from FMU (#1 = 1.0), signal from ANN (#2 = 0.0)

# evaluate the FMU by calling it, we are only interessted in `dx` in this case
function evalFMU(x)
    y, dx = fmu(; x=x)
    return dx 
end

# setup the NeuralFMU topology
net = Chain(x -> evalFMU(x),                    # take `x`, put it into the FMU, retrieve `dx`
            dx -> cache(dx),                    # cache `dx`
            dx -> dx[4:6],                      # forward only dx[4, 5, 6]
            preProcess,                         # pre-process `dx`
            Dense(3, 32, tanh),                 # Dense Layer 3 -> 32 with `tanh` activasion
            Dense(32, 1, tanh),                 # Dense Layer 32 -> 1 with `tanh` activasion 
            postProcess,                        # post process `dx`
            dx -> cacheRetrieve(5:5, dx),       # dynamics FMU | dynamics ANN
            gates,                              # compute resulting dx from ANN + FMU
            dx -> cacheRetrieve(1:4, dx, 6:6))  # stack together: dx[1,2,3,4] from cache + dx from ANN + dx[6] from cache

# build NeuralFMU
neuralFMU = ME_NeuralFMU(fmu, net, (tStart, tStop), solver; saveat=tSave)
neuralFMU.modifiedState = false # speed optimization (no ANN before the FMU)

# get start state vector from data (FMIZoo)
x0 = FMIZoo.getStateVector(data, tStart)

# simulate and plot the (uninitialized) NeuralFMU
resultNFMU_original = neuralFMU(x0, (tStart, tStop); parameters=data.params, showProgress=true) 
fig = fmiPlot(resultNFMU_original; stateIndices=5:5, label="NeuralFMU (original)", ylabel="velocity [m/s]")

# plot the original FMU and data
fmiPlot!(fig, resultFMU; stateIndices=5:5, values=false)
Plots.plot!(fig, data.speed_t, data.speed_val, label="Data")
```

### Part 2d: Initialization
In general, initialization of (phyiscs-enhanced) NeuralODEs is challenging, because ANNs are initialized random by default. In this case we are using a special initialization method introducing two gates, that control how much of the original FMU dynamics and how much of the ANN dynamics is introduced to the final model dynamics. See the paper [[1]](#Source) for a deeper insight.

## Part 3: Training

Finally: The actual training!

Basically, you can use your custom loss function, batching strategies and optimsation routines with *FMIFlux.jl*. Because we need to keep it short here, we use some tools already shipped with *FMIFlux.jl*.


```julia
# prepare training data (array of arrays required)
train_data = collect([d] for d in data.consumption_val)
train_t = data.consumption_t 

# switch to a more efficient execution configuration, allocate only a singel FMU instance, see:
# https://thummeto.github.io/FMI.jl/dev/features/#Execution-Configuration
fmu.executionConfig = FMI.FMIImport.FMU2_EXECUTION_CONFIGURATION_NOTHING
c, _ = FMIFlux.prepareSolveFMU(neuralFMU.fmu, nothing, neuralFMU.fmu.type, true, false, false, false, true, data.params; x0=x0)

# batch the data (time, targets), train only on model output index 6, plot batch elements
batch = batchDataSolution(neuralFMU, t -> FMIZoo.getStateVector(data, t), train_t, train_data;
    batchDuration=10.0, indicesModel=6:6, plot=true, parameters=data.params, showProgress=true)

# limit the maximum number of solver steps to 1e5 and maximum simulation/training duration to 30 minutes
solverKwargsTrain = Dict{Symbol, Any}(:maxiters => 1e5, :max_execution_duration => 10.0*60.0)

# picks a modified MSE, which weights the last time point MSE with 25% and the remaining element MSE with 75%
# this promotes training a continuous function, even when training on batch elements
lossFct = (a, b) -> FMIFlux.Losses.mse_last_element_rel(a, b, 0.5)
lossFct([1.0, 2.0], [0.0, 0.0]) # (1.0)^2 * 0.75 + (2.0)^2 * 0.25

# initialize a "worst error growth scheduler" (updates all batch losses, pick the batch element with largest error increase)
scheduler = LossAccumulationScheduler(neuralFMU, batch, lossFct; applyStep=1, plotStep=5, updateStep=5)
logLoss = false
updateScheduler = () -> update!(scheduler)
#scheduler = SequentialScheduler(neuralFMU, batch)
#logLoss = true 

# defines a loss for the entire batch (accumulate error of batch elements)
batch_loss = p -> FMIFlux.Losses.batch_loss(neuralFMU, batch; 
    showProgress=true, p=p, parameters=data.params, update=true, lossFct=lossFct, logLoss=true, solverKwargsTrain...) # [120s]

# loss for training, take element from the worst element scheduler
loss = p -> FMIFlux.Losses.loss(neuralFMU, batch; 
    showProgress=true, p=p, parameters=data.params, lossFct=lossFct, batchIndex=scheduler.elementIndex, logLoss=logLoss, solverKwargsTrain...)

gates.scale[:] = [0.99, 0.01] 

# gather the parameters from the NeuralFMU
params = FMIFlux.params(neuralFMU)

params[1][end-1] = 0.99
params[1][end] = 0.01

# for training, we use the Adam optimizer (with exponential decay) 
optim = Adam(1e-3) 

# initialize the scheduler 
initialize!(scheduler; parameters=data.params, p=params[1], showProgress=true) # [120s]
```

Finally, the line we are waiting for so long:


```julia
batch_loss(params[1])
FMIFlux.train!(loss, params, Iterators.repeated((), length(batch)), optim; chunk_size=length(params[1]), cb=updateScheduler) 

optim.eta *= 0.5
FMIFlux.train!(loss, params, Iterators.repeated((), length(batch)), optim; chunk_size=length(params[1]), cb=updateScheduler) 
batch_loss(params[1])

optim.eta *= 0.5
FMIFlux.train!(loss, params, Iterators.repeated((), length(batch)), optim; chunk_size=length(params[1]), cb=updateScheduler) 
batch_loss(params[1])
```

After training, it seems a good idea to store the optimized parameters for later use:


```julia
# save the parameters (so we can use them tomorrow again)
paramsPath = joinpath(@__DIR__, "params_$(scheduler.step)steps.jld2")
fmiSaveParameters(neuralFMU, paramsPath)

# switch back to the default execution configuration, see:
# https://thummeto.github.io/FMI.jl/dev/features/#Execution-Configuration
fmu.executionConfig = FMI.FMIImport.FMU2_EXECUTION_CONFIGURATION_NO_RESET
FMIFlux.finishSolveFMU(neuralFMU.fmu, c, false, true)
```

The final question is: Are we better? This can be easily checked by running a simulation and compare it to the training data:


```julia
# check what had been learned by the NeuralFMU, simulate it ...
resultNFMU_train = neuralFMU(x0, (tStart, tStop); parameters=data.params, showProgress=true, recordValues=manipulatedDerVars, maxiters=1e7) # [120s]

# Load parameters 
fmiLoadParameters(neuralFMU, paramsPath)

# are we better?
mse_NFMU = FMIFlux.Losses.mse(data.consumption_val, fmiGetSolutionState(resultNFMU_train, 6; isIndex=true))
mse_FMU  = FMIFlux.Losses.mse(data.consumption_val, fmiGetSolutionState(resultFMU, 6; isIndex=true))

# ... and plot it
fig = fmiPlot(resultNFMU_nipt; stateIndices=6:6, stateEvents=false, label="NeuralFMU (NIPT)", title="Training Data");
fmiPlot!(fig, resultNFMU_train; stateIndices=6:6, stateEvents=false, values=false, label="NeuralFMU (Train)");
fmiPlot!(fig, resultFMU; stateIndices=6:6, stateEvents=false, values=false, label="FMU");
Plots.plot!(fig, train_t, data.consumption_val, label="Data", ribbon=data.consumption_dev, fillalpha=0.3)
```
